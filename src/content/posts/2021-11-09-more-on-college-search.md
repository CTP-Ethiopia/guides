  First thing is first, make a list of all the criteria that are important to
  you. This can be generosity of financial aid, availability of research

Hi everyone, this week’s tip is about choosing colleges to apply to/attend.

\
First thing is first, make a list of all the criteria that are important to you. This can be the generosity of financial aid, availability of research opportunities, location, course requirements for a degree, the presence of an Ethiopian community e.t.c. Once you have this list, you can go on to rank your college choices. Please don’t underestimate the research you have to do before you decide to enroll in a specific school. Speak to current students, watch webinars most schools have online, check out some of their professors and the research they do, or if they have athletic programs you’d be interested in. Maybe even specifically look into the department that you’re interested in. Point is, for the sake of your future happiness, make sure the school you choose is the best fit for you.\

On the other hand, a specific school doesn’t have to be perfect as long as it meets the requirements that are most important to you. Remember that whatever school you choose, your attitude, persistence, and the people you surround yourself with are the things that make a difference to your college experience.
