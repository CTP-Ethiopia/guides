  I was literally about to fall over when I entered Savor. It was noon and I had
  been walking for the last hour in the blazing sun. The cool air in the
  amazingly ventilated room felt great against my overly heated skin. It was
  spacious, had simple furniture and was the perfect place to relax and cool
  down. And then, I saw the display. Belew! Although Savor has many choices, my
  eyes immediately zeroed in on the ice cream. I took a cone to have with my ice
  cream. One of the many things I really like about Savor’s ice cream is the
  cone. It’s a deliciously made biscuit that you could enjoy even without the
  ice cream. Another thing I really like is their generosity. They’re not stingy
  like some ice cream places who give you the bare minimum required to be called
  a scoop. At Savor, they pile it so high you forget it’s just one scoop. I’m
  sure I’ll be going back there pretty soon. Try it, the ice cream will make you
  scream.

  Address- On your way from Edna Mall to Urael Church
